# SynthFair: Synthetic Data Generation for Ensuring Subgroup Fairness
The code in the repository is developed mainly by Begüm Hattatoğlu during her master thesis project. The thesis is available at the [UU Theses Repository](https://studenttheses.uu.nl/handle/20.500.12932/40070).  This repository contains:
- Preliminary experiments conducted to compare the chosen baselines,
- Algorithmic fairness pre-processing framework implementation.
- Example execution cases of the pipeline in Jupyter Notebook.
- Experimental results from 10 times randomized executions, several plots for further insight.

NOTE: In order to run the example jupyter notebooks and py files that contains the experiments, implementation_functions.py and deepcopy.py should be in the same directory.
